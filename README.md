# COURTBASE-SQL-FrontEnd
Hey Guys :D
So this is a SQl project I made using MS SQL Server and MS SQL management studio. It is also coupled with the ASP.Net framework and C#. To use the project for your own testing you will have to edit a few things yourselves and will also have to connect the database to the SQL server on your own. I assume you are familiar with front end and SQL So I won't say what to edit. 

The project here only contains the code files I updated/made to accopany the front end in my style and layout. The packages such ass Jqeury/Bootstrap will be automatically deployed when you work on a ASP.Net framework. 

The project is very barebones so it is susceptible to trial and errors. I am also open to any suggestions in file uploading and more.

# Quick info 
I can also provide the entire project for free upon approval of usage by the request.
